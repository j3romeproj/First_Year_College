/*                                            Case Study AY 2021-2022
                                                  File Handling

    Create a file for the define a set of employee records that will have the following fields:

    Employee Structure:
    
    Employee Number         10 characters
    Employee Name           15 characters
    Status Code             R or C
    Hours Worked            999
    Deductions              99999.99

    The program will have the following requirements:

    1. Created file may be in text or binary file processing modes.
    2. Input the required data for the following fields for n employees.
    3. Status code R is for Regular and C is for Casual.
    4. If status code is R, input a basic salary amount 
    and check if the employee exceeded 160 hours of work for the month. 
    If employee exceeded 160 hours of work for the month, basic rate is basic pay amount divided by 160 hours. 
    Overtime rate is 0.5 more than his/her basic rate. Compute for Overtime pay.
    Note: Overtime hour/s is hours worked > 160.
    5. If status code is C, then input basic rate. 
    Basic salary amount is equivalent to 160 hours worked multiplied by basic rate. 
    If hours worked exceeds 160 hours then the employee is entitled to an Overtime pay which is 0.5 more than his/her basic rate. 
    Compute for Overtime pay.
    Note: Overtime hour/s is hours worked > 160.
    6. Compute for Net pay using the formula
    Net pay = Basic Pay + Overtime pay â€“ Deductions */
